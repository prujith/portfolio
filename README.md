# Machine Learning

| Project Link | Areas | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|
| üí≥ [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/prujith/DataScience_Projects/blob/main/Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb) |  Kernel density estimation plot, RobustScaler, Correlation Matrices, Winsorization outliers, Logistic Regression, Cross Validation score. | Developed various predictive models on the dataset containing transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders so that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. |
| ü¶† [42 Disease Prediction](https://github.com/prujith/DataScience_Projects/blob/main/Disease_Prediction.ipynb) | EDA, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Data Visualization, Classification Model Selection, Evaluation. | Applied Machine Learning Knowledge to field of Medical Science for making the task of Physician easy. This dataset has 132 parameters on which 42 different types of diseases can be predicted. |
| üíπ [Mobile money transactions](https://github.com/prujith/DataScience_Projects/blob/main/Fraud_Transactions_Detection.ipynb) | Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Data Visualization, Model Selection | Detected frauds in mobile money transactions based on a sample of real transactions extracted from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service implemented in an African country. |
| üè° [House Prices](https://github.com/prujith/DataScience_Projects/blob/main/House_Price_Prediction.ipynb) | EDA, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Data Visualization, Feature Selection, Regression Model Selection, Evaluation. | Predicted the sales price for each house on the dataset which has 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. |

# LLM-Langchain

| Project Link | Area | Project Description |
|---|---|---|
| ‚Åâ [QA with website](https://github.com/prujith/LLM-Langchain-Projects/blob/main/QA%20with%20Website.ipynb) | langchain, openai, beautifulsoup4, faiss-gpu | Built a conversational chat tool which using Langchain and OpenAI Large Language Model (LLM) for automated information retrieval. This tool takes a URL as input, makes API requests, scrapes web content using Beautiful Soup, tokenizes text, and embeds it with OpenAI Embeddings. Utilized FAISS for vector database management. Successfully delivered highly accurate and efficient results for user queries. |
